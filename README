This is a QuickLook plugin to preview information about OSGi bundles under OS X.

It was my first project using either OS X, Objective C and XCode so I spent more
time wrestling with the latter than actually writing code (which as a result is
more than a bit spaghetti-style, but working great nonetheless).
There are still problems with the project configuration but I included a release
built for OS X 10.6.
Just copy it into /Library/QuickLook/ or ~/Library/QuickLook/ to install.
If you have some experience coding for OS X, I'd be grateful if you could adapt
the project to build out-of-the-box.

You may contact me at mail@marcusilgner.com with any patches, enhancement
requests or comments you may have.
